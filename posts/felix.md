I worked as a Software Developer at Felix Payment Systems, a fintech company. I was full stack with a focus in web, but also did work in cloud development, database, and deployment. At the start of my employment, I was the sole developer working on a new product. I architected the initial skeleton of the project and chose the tools that would be used. I designed the project to be scalable and followed standards as defined by REST architecture. As members were added to the team, I also took a role in managing team sprints; planning out and assigning tickets accordingly.
