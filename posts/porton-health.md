I worked as a **Full Stack Developer Co-op** at Porton Health, a telehealth company, for four months. I quickly familiarized myself with the existing codebase and delivered numerous new features per sprint. Additionally, I implemented their new UI re-designs and fixed numerous bugs, leading to a cleaner product. I also supported development of a patient booking system integrated with OSCAR EMR API (an electronic medical record API). A major achievement of mine was aiding in the redesign of the existing mongoose schemas, and correcting the database to match the new design.
